## §0 TL;DR (musu fit, 3-line)

1. **Ben의 5 스킬은 "오비디안 + Claude Desktop + 클라우드 라우틴 + 릴레이 플러그인" 기반의 *개인/팀용 second brain* 셋업이다.** Notion·MCP를 의도적으로 우회하고 **로컬 폴더 + CLAUDE.md를 라우팅 맵으로 쓰는 것**을 핵심 설계로 둔다.
2. **musu와의 직접 충돌점**: Ben은 "OS MCP"를 만들어 *Anthropic 클라우드 라우틴*에서 second brain에 도달하게 한다. musu의 [[feedback-self-contained-product]] 원칙(유료 SaaS dep을 product code에 박지 않는다)과 정면 충돌. 같은 자동화를 musu-bridge + asyncio scheduler로 구현하면 무료/로컬화 가능.
3. **musu가 차용할 만한 패턴 3개**: ① CLAUDE.md를 *router map*으로 쓰는 명시적 규약, ② "OS Optimizer" 패턴 — vault hygiene을 정기 잡으로 자동화, ③ 권한별 sync(read/write per folder per member). 우리 자체 [[autonomous-loop]] 메모리 시스템에 이미 80% 있다.

## §1 원문 (verbatim, edited for paragraph breaks only)

> I believe setting up a second brain or an AI operating system is the single most valuable thing you can do in AI right now. Because once it's set up, every AI tool, every chat skill or agent you use, instantly becomes far more powerful by tapping into real-time context around you and your business. But setting it up can be overwhelming and not managing it well can lead to an unstructured mess that burns through tokens.
>
> So in this video, I'll show you five cloud skills you can copy and paste for free to help you set up your second brain or AI operating system fast and according to best practices that help you automatically update it with real-time context and skills to optimize it for token usage and performance autonomously when context grows. And lastly, I'll show you how to share this across a team while still having permission settings.
>
> Now, if you don't know me yet, I'm Ben. I run an AI agency where we implement AI operating systems for businesses and run an AI community. And these skills are direct result of helping dozens of businesses and people set this up efficiently themselves. Now, before showing you the four skills, let me quickly go over why having a second brain or a memory system like this is so important if you're still unfamiliar with it.
>
> Now, with a memory system like this, I can first of all give any AI agent or any AI provider like Codex, Co-work, or Cloud Code persistent context and memory across any chat. And this means that instead of your AI tool giving you generic outputs or you having to copy and paste relevant context in each new chat, your AI agent can always pull relevant context and memory in every new chat chat you start.
>
> For example, when I'm ideating on new YouTube videos, Cloud can instantly pull data on my strategy, my past video performance, all my transcript, my competitors, all to give me far more relevant outputs. And this memory layer can include everything about you and your business. For example, you see I have literally thousands of documents around my business, my strategy, my transcript, my daily to-do's, my departments, every YouTube transcript I've ever done, my team members and their roles, my agency's client context, etc. And this context in my second brain is also updated in real time with everything that's changing and happening in my business, for example, with meeting transcripts, Slack chats, email comms, etc.
>
> Obsidian, by the way, which is the tool that I'm showcasing here, is just a visual overlay of a file or a folder on your computer. As you can see, everything you're seeing in Obsidian is actually just stored here in a folder. Obsidian just becomes very useful because it helps you organize and visualize a very complex folder, like the one I have here, in a better way.
>
> Now, this memory layer can also be shared and used across teams in businesses. So, my entire team's AI agents and AI tools instantly become far more aligned and more powerful for my business because my entire team's AI agents now pull from the same business context, the same strategy docs, etc. And all of their specific context and expertise will also be fed into the second brain and usable across the entire team.
>
> And the reason you want to start with this as soon as possible is that this context compounds because the more you and your team use AI and the earlier you start with this, the more context it's going to build. And this means the AI agent you and your entire team have after 6 months of using this is far more powerful than the one you started with today.
>
> For example, this is what my second brain looked like 3 months ago and this is what it looks like right now. And this memory layer is also the foundation for allowing AI agents like co-work or Cloud Code Code to become the main operating system for doing work. Because if we have this foundational context layer combined with connectors and MCP that can access your software, the internet, and your computer and capabilities and features like skills, routines, and loops that can automate and execute on your work and tasks, AI really starts becoming more and more your main interface for doing work.
>
> I can tell you that the more context and the more me and my team have been using Cloud Code and co-work, the less I'm in other softwares and the more of our tasks across all our business departments are being done by these AI agents or at least assisted by these agents. This is where the world is heading and because this memory layer is the foundation, I highly encourage you to get started with this today because I think you'll be surprised how much more productive working with AI gets with this setup.
>
> So, let me walk you through the first one, which is the OS setup skill. After using this skill, you should have your initial second brain set up, something that sort of looks like this and has enough context to really make your AI and your AI agents become more powerful and productive. It can also be used to help other people set it up or even if you potentially want to do this for clients.
>
> Now, you can download all of the skills by just going in the first link in the description. Now, in there, you'll find the plugin zip file here, which you can just download. And then, if you're setting this up in the cloud desktop, you can just go to customize here, then you go to plugins here, you click on plus, you click on create plugin, and then upload plugin. Here, you can just drop in the zip file, and they should now appear here under a tab called Obsidian. Maybe the name might have changed, but you'll have a new plugin here with all of the skills listed out.
>
> In the resource, you will also find a full setup guide that walks you through the entire process step-by-step if this video might go a little bit too fast for you. And if you need more help, you can also check out my AI accelerator in the second link in the description below, where you get access to unlimited one-on-one live tech help with my team to help you with any issues or questions you might have. We also have a full in-depth course on setting up this OS together with all our skills and plugins that we're building out for ourselves and multiple weekly Q&As with me and my team. So, if that's interesting to you, definitely check it out. And if you're a business and you want me and my team to actually help set this up for you together with personalized consulting and training, you can uh check the third link in the description below to book in a free call with us.
>
> Now, this first skill will help you set up your initial second brain by helping you with the three important things to get right when setting this up. Firstly, it will help you with the initial population of context in your second brain by asking you some questions. Second, it will help set up your folder structure, which is important to make sure your second brain is organized and structured efficiently for it to be able to scale well. And thirdly, it helps you set up good Claude.md files, which are extremely important because they tell Claude how to efficiently navigate the second brain. This Claude.md file is basically the instruction layer or the map for your AI agent on Claude code or co-work on how to navigate the second brain folder. So, it tells Claude basically where to find and store information in this complex folder.
>
> And then lastly, I'll show you quickly how to set up Obsidian, which is the tool that I show here, of course, which is what you want to do after using the skill. Which again, Obsidian is a free tool to download and again is nothing more than just a visual overlay of the folder we're creating on our computer.
>
> Now, before diving into this setup skill, it's important to have the right mindset when setting this up because this second brain setup can become pretty overwhelming pretty quickly. And usually, lots of questions will pop up like, what context do I actually need? Do I have enough context? Is my file structure well? Is it all structured well enough? etc. But the important thing to keep in mind is that you want to start simple. This is not about having the perfect setup or thousands of files in there on day one. The point is about getting started simple and fast. Because once you've set this up and start using it, the second brain will grow naturally over time. I can tell you that the day I started this, I probably had around 30 or 40 documents in there. And then 6 weeks later, this grew into hundreds of documents. And now I literally have thousands.
>
> So, after you've imported the skill, you can just use the skill by going typing a slash and going OS setup. You'll see the the setup skill appear. And now one more thing we want to do is we want to create a new folder, which we'll probably call the second brain folder because this is what Claude will populate to create your initial second brain. So, you can just create a new folder and I'll call it second brain test. I open it. Click always allow. And now Claude will set up the second brain inside of this folder, which we're later going to connect to Obsidian.
>
> Now, when you run this, So, first question it asks you is what type of folder structure do you want? What type of vault do you want? Is it for solopreneurs or professional or are you a business with a team? Now, it's important to select the right one here because based on this, it's going to decide your initial folder structure.
>
> Now, I know there have been many people who've been trying to set up a second brain and it can be sort of hard to wrap your head around a good folder structure for yourself. And honestly, there is no right or wrong answer here because the perfect folder structure for me will not be the same for you because it is context dependent, business dependent, and depending on what's important to you. And just like the context, this will evolve sort of naturally too the more you use this. That being said, while helping other people setting this up and other businesses, we've seen two initial folder structures work best as initial folder structures for most people and businesses. So, one is for solopreneurs or professionals that don't have a team or don't need a team set up and one for business owners or people who want to roll this out across teams.
>
> So, in my case, I can select business and what Claude will do now is create your initial folder structure with all the sub folders inside of the folder we first selected and created the Claude MD and the index files. So, after you've done that, you'll see in the folder you selected, you now have all these sub folders. Now again, don't worry about understanding this entirely yet because this folder structure in the end is more for Claude than for you, but I'll walk you through very quickly what's going to be underneath each one.
>
> So, in the context folder, it will populate information with general information about you and your business. The daily folder will log every day's work so Claude can look back and see what happened each day across the business. The project folder will be for all the active projects. For example, with me that could be a project for each YouTube video I'm doing. Then we have an intelligence folder where meeting transcripts, calls, decisions, and competitor research for example can live. We have a resource folder where reusable stuff like prompts, frameworks, and templates can live. We can have a skills folder for every Claude skill that you build or install. And if you've picked the business setup, it's department folder for SOPs by departments, team folder where every person in the team gets their own profile with role, daily notes, and tasks, and an onboarding folder for new hires.
>
> Again, don't stress about understanding all of this on day one. It'll make a lot more sense when you have some context in here. As you can see, this is of course still empty. And besides these folders that it has set up, it has also set up the Claude.md, as you can see here. In a Claude desktop, you can also see the Claude.md here. And basically, this is that layer that instructs to Claude exactly where it can find which information based on this folder structure. So, it's already made and optimized according to what we've seen work best for these types of folder structures. And then with every new chat Claude opens, it will first read this Claude.md to know where to pull data from if it needs to. It has also set up separate Claude.md um documents for each of the subfolders to basically instruct Claude also how these subfolders are structured, which is a technique and best practice Andrej Karpathy, one of the leading AI researchers came up with. But again, this is already done for you.
>
> Now, the next thing we need to do, of course, is to populate it with the actual context about you and your business. So, the next thing the skill will do is to start asking you a series of questions to help you populate this initial sort of key information that you need to get started with your second brain. So, we'll go through a set of 12 sections to get a good initial context data set around you and your business. So, for example, the first one here is about you, uh then about the company, then about the market you're in, etc. And it will cover 12 of the most important sort of sections that you need to cover.
>
> Now, in each of these, you'll see a brain dump box, and link and file box, and you can upload any documents you might have. And this is really where you want to take your time with. My co-founder likes to say to people, uh just order a six-pack and a pizza, and just sit down for a couple of hours together with Claude, and in each of these questions, just do a a long brain dump. We we put some bullet points here too on each of the sections, so to give you some inspiration on what you can talk about. But, I highly recommend just getting a voice transcription tool like WhisperFlow and just doing a really long brain dump. Doesn't have to be structured and talk about anything around, in this case, you, your background, what's important to you, where you live, etc. Anything you can imagine, just dump it in here. Any files you might have that can relate to this. And you can also here instruct any documents that might already live in Notion, for example, or Google Drive that you can use. Because if you have the connector set up, you can pull those documents in right away. Again, this doesn't have to be structured because what will happen after you've done and gone through all of the 12 questions, it Cloud will actually structure this for you and put it in the folder structure that we just seen.
>
> So, after you've gone through those 12 questions, what you'll see is that inside of that folder, it is now actually populated it with some data. For example, right your brand, your team, your market, your infrastructure, ICP, etc. And you'll see that you already have lots of very relevant that will make outputs inside of your next chats already a lot more productive and efficient.
>
> Now, and then of course, there's one more important thing once we have this is to actually connect it with Obsidian. So, you can just download Obsidian for free from for Mac or for Windows. So, you can just download it from their website. You just have to create an account, which takes you 1 minute, and then you'll land on a screen like this. Then you select open folder as vault. We'll then select that second brain folder that you earlier created. And then you have that exact folder in a nicer visual layout. We also have that graph view, of course, where we can see the connections between all of these files. That's basically what this is. But, this is just going to become really helpful when your context start growing to actually start managing it in a better way because it becomes very complex in a in a normal folder.
>
> Now, your Obsidian might not look as fancy or colorful as mine. But, we've just applied a template to the the visual layout, which you can do here in the settings. Then you go to appearances. And here you have an option called themes. Then you can go to manage. Here you have you have lots of different ways you can visualize um Obsidian. Now, we specifically used PLN, which you can just click here. Then in the themes, you just select the PLN, and then uh you get an upgrade basically in the visualization inside of Obsidian.
>
> Once you've set this up, there are three important things to keep in mind. Firstly, every new chart we start across any AI provider, it could be Cohere, Claude Code, etc. We always want to make sure the second brain folder is selected. Second, the Claude MD does have instructions to save information when you're chatting with Claude to uh make sure to remember stuff you've done in chats. But if there's something specific that you think Claude should remember, always just make sure to tell Claude to save it as a file in your second brain. And thirdly, Claude should start pulling context automatically based on what kind of prompt you give it. But if it doesn't, you can always specify to go through your vault to uh get some extra context before answering.
>
> Now, what's missing in this initial setup, of course, is to actually populate and update the brain with real-time information on what's happening and changing in your business day-to-day. And this is exactly what the next skill will help you to do, the OS operator skill. And this skill will basically help you set up a scheduled task. And this scheduled task it will set up will pull real-time context from your business and update your second brain with it. You can see here that my vault operator scheduled task runs every day here in the back end. And it basically uses the Fireflies connector, my Circle Community connector, and the Slack connector to pull my latest meetings, my latest chat and thread discussions from Slack, and the latest threads and questions from my Circle Community.
>
> But this, of course, can be wired up to any software or platform that you want to pull real-time data from. You can imagine uh connecting your inbox or even an analytics platform, but any information that's important for your second brain to have up-to-date information or context on. You will then use this context to create daily context briefs in the daily folder. For example, you can see here in Tuesday, May 12th, because of all of this information it has, it knows exactly what critical escalations are, uh what today's calendar is, for example. You can see OS skills video filming continuation. So, it has up-to-date context around everything me and my team are working on and what our priorities right now.
>
> It also creates daily task list across all the different team members, all the meeting transcripts are saved, and it will also use this context to update your second brain or an existing file with things that might have changed. It might delete even files that became irrelevant because of the updates. You can imagine if we discussed a strategic change in our business, that it can actually start uh adapting uh the strategy document and things like this. Besides this, it even does some basic cleaning and hygiene of your second brain, like uh spotting duplications in your second brain, uh and cleaning them up or merging them. It might summarize large files. Uh it cleans up the formatting. Uh make sure wiki links are added efficiently and some other things. You can see here, I get a You get a report, too, with what kind of housekeeping it has done. And this, of course, becomes important when the context is growing. We want to keep our second brain clean and function well. But this is something that the next skill will help you out with even more.
>
> And this is really the next step to make these AI tools and AI agents become far more powerful, because now it can help you prioritize your day, become much more of a strategic sparring partner. It can help you, of course, execute on some of these day-to-day tasks, etc. And of course, you can also start building your own scheduled tasks based on this real-time data that are useful for yourself. For example, daily briefing uh scheduled tasks become interesting to set up to know, for example, what my team has been working on uh yesterday, what our priorities, etc.
>
> How do you use the skill? Again, you can just run it by using the slash command, and in this case, OS operator, after you've downloaded the skill, of course. It will then first look at your existing folder uh to understand the folder structure and then ask you how often you want to run this schedule task. Now, what I recommend is to do this at least once a day, but you can also run this multiple times a day. Of course, it's going to cost you a bit more tokens, but uh it makes sure your second brain is always up to date with the latest information. It'll then look at the connectors you've already set up in your account and spot any relevant connectors to use in this daily schedule task to pull data from in order to update your second brain. Now, if you haven't set these up, you want to think about what data uh you want to populate and make sure Claude has up-to-date context on uh and then you want to uh make sure that those are already connected connected in the customized tab.
>
> If you then approve the connectors, you can also define uh when the schedule task finds something urgent that requires human action to directly escalate it through, for example, in my case, a DM on Slack to a specific person on your team, which, in my case, I did to my co-founder. It'll then give you a summary of the schedule task it's going to create, and if you then approve, it's going to directly set up the schedule task for you, as you can see it did here. You'll then find it here in your schedule task, and it's going to call be called something like Vault Operator, and you'll see that your prompt and the instruction here is customized to your specific use case and your specific scenario and connectors. And once you switch this on, it will run on a time interval you've defined.
>
> Now, one thing to keep in mind is that these schedule tasks only run when your laptop is open and the Claude desktop is open. In order to do this autonomously, even if our computers are not open, we need to actually do it through Claude routines in Claude code. As you can see here, I have a routine set up, too, and this one runs actually autonomously, even if my computer's not open. But in order to do this, we need to set up an MCP out of our second brain, which is exactly what the last, the fifth skill I'm going to show in this video, helps you to do. But these schedule tasks that I showed are definitely enough when you just get started, but if you're interested in setting this up and to run autonomously, even if your computer is not open, uh make sure to check out the last skill of this video.
>
> Now, when we start using the second brain more and context grows, what will happen is that the context bloats. And when the context bloats, it's going to lead to inefficiencies in the second brain, which can lead to higher token spend, your AI might become slower, your AI agent might be pulling in irrelevant context in chats, maybe we have duplicate or conflicting information in the second brain along with a host of other issues.
>
> So, what we need to do in order to have your second brain function well with growing context is to do regular audits, hygiene checks, and optimizations. Now, this is exactly what the next skill, the OS optimizer skill, helps you do. Cloud actually very recently announced that they're launching a dream feature, which is aimed at doing something very similar, but at the moment it's only available in managed agents. As you can see here, I ran the skill, it then audited my torque tire folder and lots of different things, spotted potential problems or inefficiencies, and fixed anything that could harm the second brain from working well. At the end, it gives me a full dashboard that basically shows everything that it has optimized in my second brain infrastructure. So, we can see that there were 1,700 files audited, it found 34 potential problems, it fixed 32, and improved the health score from 46 to 94.
>
> Now, how does this skill do that? Now, there are a lot of smart people like Andrej Karpathy and others who've come up with great frameworks and best practices on how to maintain, optimize, and manage large amounts of context and memory. And we've basically taken multiple of these frameworks and put them together into one skill. As you can see, we have Anthropic's best practices on architecture, the Cloud MD, the dream framework, and manage memory. We have the Caveman compression method, we have the Chroma context rot method, and Karpathy's N & M wiki, along with some others.
>
> Now, I'll not bore you with all of these frameworks, but what this skill basically does is it first audits your second brain and detects anything that could potentially interfere with that. And then, based on these frameworks, it optimizes everything to make sure your second brain is clean, optimized for token spend, and efficiently pulls data and saves data from the right sources. And it does that by optimizing, for example, the Claude MD, the Claude MD index files for token usage and routing efficiency. The Claude MD, of course, is uh the text file that Claude always pulls in in every chat. So, having that optimized is going to make a big difference in your token spend over the long run, and also make sure that they're actually pulling relevant data.
>
> It also spots uh duplicates, for example, in your uh second brain and merges them. It also detects stale context, flags files that are unreachable, and resolves conflicting information in the brain. It helps also with uh folder structure organization and might even propose structural reorganizations, depending on your setup. It also does a full hygiene check, where it checks for broken wiki links, bad formatting, removes irrelevant data, and adds tags and front matter fields.
>
> Now, this OS Optimizer skill is a skill you want to run routinely, probably on a weekly or bi-weekly at least, to make sure it's optimized as it grows and expands. You could also, again, put this in a scheduled task or in a routine in order to make this run autonomously. Now, again, in order to run this through a routine autonomously, you'll need to set up an MCP out of your second brain, which is what the last skill of this video helps you to do.
>
> Now, the next skill, the team OS skill, will be very useful if you have a business and want to start rolling this out across the company and different team members. Now, as I said, if your business and you have a shared second brain or memory layer, everyone's AI agents instantly become far more powerful and more aligned with the business. And this solves a big problem that AI still has to, which is that AI always tends to agree with everything. And because each team member in a business does have a different perspective, uh always has differences in views, they're not always necessarily aligned with the business strategy. There's a really interesting article that talks about exactly this, uh about institutional AI versus individual AI, that talks about exactly this alignment issue, which I highly recommend you check out if you want to learn more about this. I'll make sure to put it in a free resource link, too.
>
> Now, the two challenges with this shared OS setup that this skill solves is that firstly, of course, these are local folders stored on your computer, and this quick skill allows for these local files to be synced and updated in real time throughout all of the team members. But second, when rolling this out across a team, you want to likely have edit and permission settings set up um because some of these docs are private, uh some of these docs I don't want my team members to actually be able to update, like the strategy doc, for example. So, we do want to have those permission and control settings.
>
> Now, we've tried a lot of different methods to do this across our business, but most of these methods had limitation. Now, you can use GitHub, for example, where you add and update the entire second brain into a GitHub repository and then distribute it across the team. The problem is that this is not in real time. So, we need to actually manually update each time we make a change in the second brain for it to be shared across the team.
>
> Now, another thing I see many businesses do is they try to set this up this second brain through a cloud-based software, for example, in Google Drive or Notion. And this is an option, of course, too, where instead of the second brain living in a folder on your computer, we just store all of the documents in one of these softwares. The big downside of this setup and why I wouldn't necessarily recommend you to do this is that the only way to pull or update context from a cloud-based software is through MCPs. And MCPs basically add a complexity layer on top of all of this for your AI agents. Because besides figuring out how to navigate the context in second brain, it also has to go through the layer of the MCP. And that extra layer comes at a cost. It comes at a cost of accuracy of context retrieval. It comes at a cost of speed. MCPs uh take longer than folder access. It will also mean more tokens spent because MCPs will use more tokens. So, this might be fine for smaller setups, but if you're planning to grow this second brain, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.
>
> Now, another option is the Obsidian Sync, which is a native feature in Obsidian that allows you to do this. But again, the downside here is that it's not real-time. You have to click every time you want to update and share this across the business. And there are also no permission settings. So, what we found is the best option is to use an Obsidian plugin called Relay.
>
> Now, Relay allows you to real-time sync contacts in multiple folders automatically. And you can download it by just going to the community plugins, then click browse here, and look for the Relay plugin. You can just download it by clicking on it. Once you've done that, you can then share your entire second brain folder with a team member. He will then also have to install the Relay plugin on Obsidian. And you can then sync the data between both of your folders through the settings here. So, you can go through each of the folders and decide which one you want to sync. You do this by setting up a Relay server, which you can do here. You'll then get a key, and as soon as the other person, the team member, puts in the key, you it will appear here, and you can decide what will be synced. So, this is a pretty fast and easy way to have that shared OS.
>
> Now, one big limitation with this Relay plugin is that we don't actually have read or write permissions. So, that's why we built our own plugin on top of this Relay plugin, which gives you those permission settings, which is what this last skill will help you set up really easily. So, you want to run this skill after you've already set up the Relay plugin. And once you've done that, you can run the skill. So, once you've set that up, you can run the skill. And once you run the skill, it will first tell you what it's going to do. It's going to delete the old Relay plugin, and then it will install our custom-built plugin, the Ben AI Relay plugin, on top of it automatically inside of your Obsidian account. So, you actually have these permission and edit settings. It will then ask you to close the Obsidian app before it proceeds. And it will then swap the Relay plugin for our plugin. And once it's done, you'll now have an updated plugin, which you can find directly in Obsidian.
>
> Which, if you now just reopen Obsidian, you'll find in your plugins section in the settings, you'll see Ben AI Relay. And if you go in your settings now, I can define specific team members for specific folders, and I can also have role-based access, for example, member versus owner. So, I can read the files, but can't actually edit them, while an owner can actually edit them. For example, my strategy doc is now accessible by my team members, but can't be updated by my team members' AI agents. Now, again, I highly recommend doing this once you've actually worked with your own second brain a little bit for yourself, and probably a couple weeks before really trying to roll this out across entire team, because it's going to add complexity. But, of course, if everyone taps into and feeds into the same foundational business context layer, maybe has shared skills set up even where these skills can be used across the team, and AI just becoming far more aligned across the business, this can become a very powerful setup.
>
> Which brings me to the last skill, the OS MCP skill, which will allow you to build an MCP out of your second brain, and that will allow you to let your OS operator skill and your optimizer skill, these two, to run completely autonomously through a routine or a managed agent. And through that, it means that these recurring workflows to update your second brain and maintain your second brain are not only running when you have your cloud desktop open or your laptop open, but can also run with your laptop closed autonomously.
>
> Now, if you don't know what a routine or a managed agents is yet, it's basically a cloud feature here that you can find in the cloud code tab, and here you have routines. And these are basically ways we can let agents run not locally, like we do in co-work, cloud code, or through these scheduled tasks, but we actually run them in the cloud, so they can always run no matter if your computer is open or not. And second, these routines can also be event-triggered, not just time-triggered. So, for example, we can run this every time a Fireflies meeting finishes to process the transcript.
>
> So, you can see I have my second brain operator routine set up here that will run every day. So, here you can see it ran 1 hour ago without my involvement, but will also run if if my laptop's closed. And because these routines are run on the cloud, we can't actually give them access to local folders on a computer, which is of course where our second brain is stored. So, you can see in the setup of this routine, it actually has access to an MCP or a connector of my second brain. And this is exactly what this scale helps you set up, build an MCP out of that second brain.
>
> I also have a full routines video if you want to dive a little bit deeper into this specific feature, but for the purpose of this video, I'll focus it more on setting up an MCP out of your second brain. So, how do we do this? First, we want to make sure that we already have the relay plugin from the previous scale already installed because it's going to be built on top of that. So, you can just run the scale, and the first thing it will do is it's going to install relay, which is what basically the server where our second brain is going to live. That should work in Cloud Code Work, but if it doesn't, you can just switch to the code tab, run the scale again from there, and then it should be able to install relay.
>
> Now, once it's done that, it will give you a link. You can then just create an account, and then you have to get an access token, an API token. So, you can just create a token here. You can give it any random name. I've created it in a new workspace. Once you've created a token, all you do is copy that, and you paste it into the chat, and that's all you really need to do. Now, it's created your server and will give you a Vault MCP link. So, here's a public URL. You want to copy this one. And if you're using Cloud Code, you will have the command line here. Just copy this link. You go to customize. You go to the connectors tab, and you click on plus. There you can click on add custom. And here's where you want to add in in the remote MCP server URL that link that you just copied. You can give it again any name you want. Then you click add.
>
> And then lastly, we have to connect it to relay in order to access our actual second brain. So, we can just click here. And now you want to fill out the email that you've used to set up relay in the previous step. If you don't have a password yet, you can just go on forget password. You'll get a password through your email. Then you sign in, and then you have your relay connected, and then it will be listed here in your connectors tab, and you'll have your second brain as an MCP.
>
> And then if you want to run your Vault Operator schedule task into a routine, so it can run autonomously, you can just use that exact same prompt and use it in a cloud routine. So, you switch to the code tab, you set up a new routine, you select remote, so that's how it's run in the cloud. You can give it a name. You just paste in the prompt. You define the schedule, how often you want to run this, and then the connectors. So, you want to delete everything except for the uh the connectors it needs and the second brain. So, in this case, that would be uh Fireflies and brain, maybe Google Calendar, my email. Once you've pasted in the prompt, this will basically work like a scheduled task, but will run autonomously.
>
> Now again, if you want more help with setting up your OS, we have a full more in-depth course in my AI Accelerator. We also have unlimited one-on-one live tech help to help you with any issues or problems you might have. We also list all our internal skills and plugins that we build out to automate our marketing, sales, and operational workflows that you can use and customize for yourself. We also have courses on all of the major platforms and a community with serious professionals and business owners. So, if you want to dive a little bit deeper into this, I love to see you there.
>
> And if you're a business and you want us to set this up for you, besides some consulting and training on how to actually manage this over the long term, you can book in a free call with us in the third link in the description.
>
> Now, thank you so much for watching. I hope this was helpful, and if you want to learn more about the AI OS or the second brain setup, you can also check out the video here above.

## §2 5개 스킬 요약표

| # | Skill | 기능 | 작동 방식 | musu 대응물 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **OS Setup** | second brain 폴더 + CLAUDE.md + 12-question 컨텍스트 인터뷰 | 슬래시 커맨드 → 폴더 생성 → 사용자 brain-dump 12회 → 폴더 분류 | (없음 — musu는 코드베이스, second brain은 *유저별 컨텍스트 레이어*) |
| 2 | **OS Operator** | 매일 외부 connector(Fireflies/Slack/Circle 등)에서 데이터 pull → daily brief 작성, vault 업데이트 | Claude Desktop scheduled task (laptop open 필요) | musu-bridge `_peer_crash_sweeper` 같은 asyncio scheduler 패턴 + workflow runner (V23.4 T2-A')와 거의 동형 |
| 3 | **OS Optimizer** | vault 정기 hygiene: dedup/stale 감지/wiki link 정합성/CLAUDE.md 토큰 최적화 | 슬래시 커맨드, 주/격주 수동 실행 권장 | musu-bridge `applyMigrations` + indexer doc audit (wiki/450 같은 정기 qual eval) |
| 4 | **Team OS (Relay+권한 플러그인)** | local 폴더를 팀 간 실시간 sync + 권한별 read/write | Obsidian Relay 플러그인 (third-party SaaS) 위에 Ben의 자체 플러그인 layering | musu의 cross-machine 동기화 모델은 WebRTC + watch dispatcher (V23.1+B). Ben의 플러그인과 *동형이 아니다* — musu는 P2P, Ben은 hub-and-spoke |
| 5 | **OS MCP** | local vault를 Anthropic Cloud Routines에서 접근 가능하게 MCP server 노출 | Relay 서버 호스팅 + 클라우드 라우틴이 MCP로 vault에 접근 | musu-bridge HTTP API가 사실상 동일 역할. 단, [[feedback-self-contained-product]] 위반 없이 *로컬* 동작 |

---

## §3 핵심 설계 결정점 (Ben이 명시한 것 + 함의)

### §3.1 MCP를 피한다 (단, 클라우드 라우틴은 예외)

Ben의 주장:
> "the only way to pull or update context from a cloud-based software is through MCPs. And MCPs basically add a complexity layer ... costs at accuracy of context retrieval ... speed ... more tokens spent."

**Notion·Google Drive로 second brain을 두지 말라**는 강한 주장. *로컬 폴더 + CLAUDE.md를 router map으로*가 핵심. musu의 codebase + docs/ 폴더 구조와 정확히 같은 원리.

함의: musu 내부에도 second brain 같은 *유저 컨텍스트 vault*를 둔다면, MCP 우회하고 musu-bridge HTTP API로 직접 노출하는 게 Ben의 logic과 일관됨.

### §3.2 CLAUDE.md를 router map으로 — Karpathy 패턴 채용

Ben이 인용한 Karpathy 패턴:
> "It has also set up separate Claude.md documents for each of the subfolders to basically instruct Claude also how these subfolders are structured, which is a technique and best practice Andrej Karpathy ... came up with."

이게 musu가 이미 하고 있는 것이다:
- `C:\Users\empty\.claude\CLAUDE.md` (global instructions)
- `F:\workspace\musu-bee\CLAUDE.md` (project instructions) — 존재 여부 확인 필요
- `MEMORY.md` index + 슬러그 파일 시스템

Ben의 *folder-scoped CLAUDE.md*는 musu의 *memory-system-by-type* (user/feedback/project/reference)와 같은 동기를 가진 다른 구현.

### §3.3 OS Operator = scheduled enrichment job

Ben의 OS Operator는 매일:
1. Fireflies → 미팅 트랜스크립트 fetch
2. Slack → 스레드 fetch
3. Circle → 커뮤니티 스레드 fetch
4. 분석 → daily brief 작성
5. urgent → Slack DM 에스컬레이션

**musu의 동형 컴포넌트**: V23.4 T2-A' workflow runner (wiki/432 + wiki/436). asyncio + SQLite 기반. 차이점:
- Ben: Anthropic Cloud Routines로 *클라우드 자동 실행* (laptop closed OK)
- musu: 유저 PC의 musu-bridge 자체가 *항상 켜짐* (peer crash sweeper + workflow executor). 클라우드 라우틴이 필요 없음.

### §3.4 OS Optimizer = vault hygiene as a job

Ben이 인용한 프레임워크:
- Anthropic's best practices on architecture
- CLAUDE.md dream framework
- Caveman compression method
- Chroma context rot method
- Karpathy's N&M wiki

기능 목록 (Ben verbatim):
- duplicate detection + merge
- stale context flag
- conflicting info resolve
- broken wiki link fix
- bad formatting cleanup
- irrelevant data removal
- tags + frontmatter addition
- CLAUDE.md token efficiency optimization

**musu 대응**: 우리는 매 master plan iteration마다 qual eval doc (wiki/371, wiki/450) 작성 + index re-sync (task #373) + 정기 doc audit (task #374)을 *수동으로* 한다. Ben처럼 routine화하면 token saving 있음. *YAGNI 체크 필요* — [[feedback-no-yagni-architecture]]에 따라 현재 musu docs 폴더 크기(~150 files)가 hygiene-as-a-job을 정당화하는지 검증해야 함.

### §3.5 Permission-aware sync — musu와 정반대 모델

Ben:
> "I can read the files, but can't actually edit them, while an owner can actually edit them. For example, my strategy doc is now accessible by my team members, but can't be updated by my team members' AI agents."

이게 musu의 P2P 모델과 *근본적으로 다르다*:
- Ben: hub-and-spoke + read/write role per folder per member
- musu: peer-to-peer, no central hub, each PC owns its agents/companies

musu에 직접 적용 불가. 다만 *musu가 SaaS 변형(musu.pro)을 만들 때* 다시 의미가 생길 수 있음 — 그 시점에 wiki/360 V23.2 prep + [[feedback-self-contained-product]] 재검토 필요.

---

## §4 musu 현황 대비 gap analysis

| Ben의 5개 스킬 기능 | musu 보유 여부 | gap / overlap |
|---|---|---|
| 로컬 폴더 + CLAUDE.md router | ✅ 보유 (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` + memory/) | overlap 90%, Ben의 12-section interview는 *유저 prompt skill*로 차용 가치 있음 |
| 외부 connector → daily ingest | 🟡 부분 보유 (musu-bridge가 PC들의 텔레메트리 ingest는 하지만 Fireflies/Slack 같은 외부 SaaS는 아님) | gap: 외부 connector adapter layer (V23.5 후보) |
| vault hygiene as job | 🟡 *수동* 실행 (qual eval doc 작성 시) | gap: 자동화 (asyncio scheduler 후보, ~50 LOC) |
| 팀 간 권한 sync | ❌ 미보유 (musu는 P2P, share/permission 모델 다름) | musu 모델과 충돌. SaaS변형 시 재고 |
| MCP for cloud routines | ❌ 미보유 (의도적 — [[feedback-self-contained-product]] 위반) | musu에는 *적용하지 말 것*. 같은 효과를 musu-bridge HTTP로 로컬화 |

---

## §5 musu에 도입할 가치가 있는 것 (단기/중기)

### 5.1 단기 (V23.5 후보, ≤200 LOC)

**OS Optimizer 패턴 차용 — docs hygiene scheduler**:
- musu-bridge에 weekly cron asyncio job 추가
- 스캔 대상: F:\workspace\musu-bee\docs\*.md
- 작업: wiki link 정합성 검증, MEMORY.md index 동기화 체크, stale wiki/* 발견 시 escalation
- **gate**: 현재 docs 폴더 크기 측정 필요. ~150 files 미만이면 YAGNI per [[feedback-no-yagni-architecture]]. 측정 후 결정.

### 5.2 중기 (V24 후보)

**유저 context vault skill** (musu 외부, 유저 컴퓨터 셋업용):
- Ben의 OS Setup 스킬을 musu agent용으로 변형
- 12-section interview → musu agent persona/preferences/workflow seed
- musu-bridge가 vault를 *agents context*로 expose
- **단, MCP 없이 musu-bridge 로컬 HTTP만 사용** — [[feedback-self-contained-product]] 준수

### 5.3 도입하지 말 것

- ❌ Anthropic Cloud Routines + MCP 의존 (locked-in to paid SaaS, product-code dep)
- ❌ Relay 플러그인 의존 (third-party SaaS, single point of failure)
- ❌ Obsidian 의존 (visualization tool이지만, musu가 강제하면 *유저 강제* — self-contained 위반에 가깝다. *권장*은 OK, *의존*은 NO)

---

## §6 agent-team mode 관점 (MODE_Agent_Team.md cross-check)

Ben의 OS Optimizer는 사실상 **반복 실행 Auditor + Builder의 무한 루프**다:
1. audit (find duplicates/stale/broken)
2. fix (merge/remove/rewrite)
3. report (dashboard with health score)

이건 우리의 **Phase 5 Auditor + Phase 6 audit-fix Builder** 사이클을 *플랜 문서가 아닌 second brain 자체에 적용한 것*. wiki/450 iter-2 qual eval에서 이미 validated된 Critic-Auditor delta 패턴이 *vault context*에도 동일하게 작동할 가능성.

**hypothesis**: musu docs 폴더에 OS Optimizer 패턴 1주일 적용 시, wiki/* 간 cross-reference 정합성 (broken [[wiki/xxx]] link)이 측정 가능한 수치로 개선될 것. 측정 후 V24에서 정식 채용 여부 결정.

---

## §7 핵심 인용 — verbatim 보존 (재참조용)

**Q1. MCP 회피 근거 (Ben)**:
> "MCPs basically add a complexity layer on top of all of this for your AI agents. Because besides figuring out how to navigate the context in second brain, it also has to go through the layer of the MCP. And that extra layer comes at a cost. It comes at a cost of accuracy of context retrieval. It comes at a cost of speed."

**Q2. CLAUDE.md router 패턴 (Ben, Karpathy 인용)**:
> "It has also set up separate Claude.md documents for each of the subfolders to basically instruct Claude also how these subfolders are structured, which is a technique and best practice Andrej Karpathy, one of the leading AI researchers came up with."

**Q3. context bloat 경고 (Ben)**:
> "When we start using the second brain more and context grows, what will happen is that the context bloats. And when the context bloats, it's going to lead to inefficiencies in the second brain, which can lead to higher token spend, your AI might become slower, your AI agent might be pulling in irrelevant context in chats."

**Q4. simple start 강조 (Ben)**:
> "The day I started this, I probably had around 30 or 40 documents in there. And then 6 weeks later, this grew into hundreds of documents. And now I literally have thousands."

이건 [[feedback-no-yagni-architecture]]와 정확히 일치한다 — "industry standard"는 1000+ scale, 시작은 30-40에서 simple하게.
